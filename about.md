# About Me

Hello! I'm **secwexen**, a cybersecurity expert.  
This site is my personal knowledge base, portfolio, and collection of technical write-ups.

I focus on:

- Offensive security research  
- Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges  
- Security tool exploration and reviews  
- Technical articles and tutorials

This repository is **not a traditional software project**.  
It serves as a supporting workspace for notes, experiments, and ongoing learning.

## Philosophy

My approach to cybersecurity emphasizes:

- Understanding systems deeply rather than relying solely on tools  
- Learning through practice, documentation, and reflection  
- Sharing knowledge responsibly through write-ups and tutorials
